# Getting Started with Create React App
## Quick Overview

```
 npx create-react-app my-app
 cd my-app
 npm start
```

If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

Then open http://localhost:3000/ to see your app.
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

```
npm start
```

## Get Started Immediately
You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

## Create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App
You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

## npx

```
npx create-react-app my-app
```

(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

## npm

```
npm init react-app my-app
```

npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+

## Yarn
```
yarn create react-app my-app
```

yarn create <starter-kit-package> is available in Yarn 0.25+

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    ├── App.css
    ├── App.js
    ├── App.test.js
    ├── index.css
    ├── index.js
    ├── logo.svg
    └── serviceWorker.js
    └── setupTests.js

No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app.
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

## npm start or yarn start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

# Build errors

## npm test or yarn test
Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

# Read more about testing.

# npm run build or yarn build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

## `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
